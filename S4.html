<P ALIGN=CENTER>Not all clouds are the same. There are three different ways to deploy cloud computing resources:<BR><I>i.e  public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud.</I><P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>They are as follows:</p>
<DL>
<DT>1. PUBLIC CLOUD:</DT>
<DD>Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet.<BR> <I>Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. </I><BR>With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.</DD><BR>

<BR>
<DT>2. PRIVATE CLOUD:</DT>
<DD>A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.</DD><BR>

<BR>
<DT>2. HYBRID CLOUD:</DT>
<DD>Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, hybrid cloud gives businesses greater flexibility and more deployment options.</DD><BR>
