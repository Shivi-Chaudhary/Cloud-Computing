<P ALIGN=center>A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server.<BR> The server is often (but not always) on another computer system, in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network.<BR> The term applies to the role that programs or devices play in the client–server model.
<FONT COLOR=BLACK SIZE=5><br>For example, web browsers are clients that connect to web servers and retrieve web pages for display. Email clients retrieve email from mail servers.

<FONT COLOR="#009933" SIZE=5><P ALIGN=center>A client is part of a client–server model, which is still used today.<BR> Clients and servers may be computer programs run on the same machine and connect via inter-process communication techniques.<BR> Combined with Internet sockets, programs may connect to a service operating on a possibly remote system through the Internet protocol suite.<BR>Servers wait for potential clients to initiate connections that they may accept.
